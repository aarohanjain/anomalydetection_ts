# Anomaly Detection in Time Series - ARIMA

In this example repository, some rudimentary code is included to provide a practical application to the topics discussed in the literature review.
Time series data is obtained from https://trends.google.com/trends/.

For the ARIMA model, the implementation by the statsmodel library is used.
See: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html

The 'searches' directory should contain csv files containing time series data from Google Trends.
The 'figures' directory would house all generated figures by the anomaly detection script.
